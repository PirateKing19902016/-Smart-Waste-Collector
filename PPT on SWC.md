  1. [FLOATING TRASH SKIMMERS](https://www.cleantecinfra.com/trash-skimming/)![](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5846d2c0e6f2e12d64d4ca6d/t/585a7499cd0f681882fc63a2/1482323098617/Ganga+-+Sangam.jpg)
    - Collects floating trash and litter such as plastics, bottles, religious waste etc
    - Gates on either side of collection head guide material towards conveyor and then close to trap the material

  2. [AMPHIBIOUS EXCAVATORS](https://www.cleantecinfra.com/desilting/)![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/bpEbv9kxAmY/maxresdefault.webp)
    - Environmentally friendly as water is not pumped out resulting in much less turbidity
    - 50 feet reach with 360 degree rotation to discharge silt directly on shore

  3. [Ro-Boat: An Autonomous River Cleaning Robot](https://youtu.be/j49T4-yNe80)
    - Remote controlled
    - Applicable only for still water


  4. [Seabin](http://seabinproject.com/the-product/) ![Project](http://seabinproject.com/wp-content/uploads/Seabin_Project_V5_hybrid_in_action_bottle_380x272-295x220.png)
    - The Seabin moves up and down with the range of tide collecting all floating rubbish.
    - Water is sucked in from the surface and passes through a catch bag inside the Seabin, with a submersible water pump capable of displacing 25.000 LPH (litres per hour), plugged directly into 110/220 V outlet.
    - The water is then pumped back into the marina leaving litter and debris trapped in the catch bag to be disposed of properly.
