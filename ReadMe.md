    1. Collects floating trash and litter such as plastics, bottles, religious waste etc.
    2. Gates on either side of collection head guide material towards conveyor and then close to trap the material

    1. Environmentally friendly as water is not pumped out resulting in much less turbidity
    2. 50 feet reach with 360 degree rotation to discharge silt directly on shore

    1. Remote controlled
    2. Applicable only for still water
    3. High Power dozer to lift heavy objects

    1. The Seabin moves up and down with the range of tide collecting all floating rubbish.
    2. Water is sucked in from the surface and passes through a catch bag inside the Seabin, with a submersible water pump capable of displacing 25.000 LPH (litres per hour), plugged directly into 110/220 V outlet.
    3. The water is then pumped back into the marina leaving litter and debris trapped in the catch bag to be disposed of properly.
